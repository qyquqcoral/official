                            only collect this information when you explicitly consent to enable location permissions,
                            and will only use it when necessary.</li>

                    <p><strong>Sharing</strong>:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Unless otherwise specified in this Agreement, we will not actively share your personal
                            information with third parties without your consent. However, in the following
                            circumstances, we may share relevant information:</li>

                            abnormal data) with the Game development team or affiliated companies to conduct Game
                            security analysis, service improvement, and optimize user experience. We will take
                            appropriate compliance measures in accordance with relevant laws and regulations to ensure
                            that the shared personal information complies with legal requirements, require the recipient
                            to strictly abide by the agreement reached with you, collect and use your information in
                            accordance with the agreement, and take necessary data protection measures.</li>

                            de-identification) with advertising partners, so as to achieve targeted advertising delivery
                            and advertising effect evaluation. We will require advertising partners to comply with
                            strict data privacy protection measures and requirements to prevent personal identification
                            and protect your privacy and security.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <ol start="2">
                        <li><strong>Transfer</strong>: We will not transfer your personal information to other
                            companies, organizations, or individuals, unless we have obtained your explicit consent in
                            advance, or in accordance with the requirements of laws and regulations, mandatory orders
                            from administrative or judicial authorities, or in the event of transactions such as company
                            merger, acquisition, or asset transfer. Under such circumstances, we will conduct a data

                            information with the transferee, and require the transferee to continue to fulfill the

                            unless we have obtained your explicit consent, or based on legal requirements (such as court
                            judgments, government agency instructions), or in necessary situations such as protecting
                            public interests and maintaining the security and order of the Game, and make appropriate
                            disclosures within the scope permitted by law.</li>

                    <h2>III. Storage of Personal Information</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Storage Location</strong>: The information and data we collect about you will be
                            stored in [Specific Country/Region Where Servers Are Located], and may be transmitted
                            outside the country/region where you are located and accessed, stored, and displayed
                            overseas. If cross-border transmission is involved, we will take appropriate measures in
                            accordance with relevant laws and regulations to ensure that your personal information is
                            fully protected.</li>
                        <li><strong>Storage Period</strong>: We will only retain your personal information for the
                            period necessary to achieve the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy. After the expiration
                            of this period, we will delete or anonymize the relevant information. The specific period is
                            determined based on different types of information and the requirements of relevant laws and
                            regulations. For example, Game account information will be deleted within [X] days after you
                            cancel your account; in-Game log information will be retained for [X] months for
                            troubleshooting and data analysis, and then deleted.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h2>IV. Information Security</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>We adopt a variety of security measures, including but not limited to data encryption (such
                            as using SSL/TLS encryption protocol to transmit sensitive information, encrypting stored
                            user passwords), access control (setting strict access permissions, only authorized
                            personnel can access specific data), and regular security audits, to ensure that your
                            personal information is protected at a reasonable security level.</li>
                        <li>Despite the above security measures we have taken, please note that there is no "absolutely
                            perfect security measure" on the information network. In the event of a personal information
                            security incident, we will immediately activate the emergency response plan, take reasonable
                            measures to reduce losses, and promptly inform you and relevant regulatory authorities of
                            the incident situation and handling progress in accordance with the requirements of laws and
                            regulations.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h2>V. Your Rights</h2>

                        <li><strong>Right of Access</strong>: You have the right to access your personal information in
                            this Game at any time, including account information, in-Game personal data, etc. You can

                            service staff.</li>
                        <li><strong>Right of Correction</strong>: If you find that the personal information about you
                            collected and stored by us is incorrect, you have the right to request us to correct it. You
                            can submit a correction application through the in-Game feedback channel or by contacting
                            customer service, and we will handle it promptly after verification.</li>
                        <li><strong>Right of Deletion</strong>: Under the circumstances specified in relevant laws and
                            regulations, you have the right to request us to delete your personal information. For
                            example, after you cancel your Game account, we will delete the personal information related
                            to your account in accordance with regulations. However, in some cases, due to legal
                            requirements or business needs, we may not be able to delete all information immediately
                            (such as transaction records that need to be retained for a certain period of time to comply
                            with tax, audit and other legal regulations), and we will anonymize the relevant information
                            to ensure that your personal identity can no longer be identified.</li>
                        <li><strong>Right to Withdraw Consent</strong>: For certain personal information that requires
                            your authorization and consent to collect and use, you have the right to withdraw your
                            consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent by modifying the Game settings or
                            contacting our customer service staff, but withdrawing consent may affect the normal use of
                            some Game functions that rely on this authorization.</li>
                    </ol>

                            Policy, we will publish a change notice in a prominent position in the Game or through other
                            appropriate methods (such as in-game messages, official announcements) to inform you of the
                            revised content and effective date.</li>
                        <li>If you continue to use the services of this Game after the revision of this Privacy Policy,

                            revised content, you have the right to stop using the Game services and may request us to
                            delete your personal information in accordance with the provisions of this Policy.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <ol>
                        <li>The interpretation, implementation, and dispute resolution of this Privacy Policy shall be
                            governed by the laws of [Specific Region for Legal Application]. If any dispute arises
                            between you and us due to this Privacy Policy, it shall first be resolved through friendly
                            negotiation; if negotiation fails, either party may file a lawsuit with a people's court
                            with jurisdiction.</li>
