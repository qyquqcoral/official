                            derivative works of, or use data gathering or extraction tools in connection with the
                            Services;</li>
                        <li>reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell, or otherwise exploit the Services, in whole or in

                            consent of the respective owner;</li>
                        <li>use any data mining tools or automation tools such as spiders, crawlers, scripts, bots, or
                            any automated method of recording information;</li>
                        <li>use any meta-tags or any other "hidden text" utilizing "Word Game," its affiliates, partners
                            or artists without Word Game's express written permission; or</li>
                        <li>engage in any conduct in connection with the Services that may be considered illegal or

                        Services is terminated or suspended for any reason; (b) you breach these Terms; (c) Word Game
                        discontinues availability of the Service; or (d) you disassociate from the Service.</p>
